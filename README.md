## Project Overview
FishNet aims to assist in the early detection and monitoring of invasive fish species. The application processes video frames in real-time, identifies different fish species, and alerts relevant stakeholders when invasive species are detected.

## Features
- Real-time fish species detection
- Alerts and notifications for invasive species
- Data logging for further analysis
- User-friendly interface for fishermen and researchers

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FishNet.git
   cd FishNet
